abstract = {Enormous amounts of data are growing because of the continuous and increasing use of smart devices which connect, collect, exchange and transfer these large amounts of data. With the convergence of new technologies like Internet of Things (IoT), Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs), and Cloud Computing (CC) many sectors are benefited. Our research has to do with Big Data Delivery over the IoT. Specifically, in our research, we are trying to investigate new communication protocols, new security mechanisms, new efficient, faster, safer, and energy efficient solutions and algorithms for healthcare systems (hospital buildings, rooms, etc.). The aim of our research is to create and propose suitable algorithms for efficient transmission of health big data, for management issues, for the analysis of IoT data and for security solutions. Our current position is the experimentation with IoT devices, IoT health data, big data analytics, and healthcare systems. In this paper, we present some of the challenges and the issues of Big Data. We also present work that has been done by other researchers. Finally, is presented an open source tool for experimentation, so that we can view the system in detail. Such a tool is the Cooja emulator which is part of the Contiki O.S., and is presented also in this paper. As future work, we manage to implement such a healthcare system, provide more efficient algorithms, and investigate new protocols for more efficient and secure transmissions of the sensitive health data. By these improvements, we are going to provide better healthcare and faster diagnosis to everybody.},
